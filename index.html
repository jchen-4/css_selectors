          <p>RAMEN IS A NOODLE SOUP DISH THAT WAS ORIGINALLY
        IMPORTED FROM CHINA AND HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST
      POPULAR DISHES IN JAPAN IN RECENT DECADES. RAMEN ARE IN-EXPENSIVE
    AND WIDELY AVAILABLE. TWO FACTORS THAT ALSO MAKE THEM AN IDEAL OPTION
  FOR BUDGET TRAVELERS. RAMEN RESTAURANTS, OR RAMEN-YA, CAN BE FOUND IN VIRTUALLY
EVERY CORNER OF THE COUNTRY AND PRODUCE COUNTLESS REGIONAL VARIATIONS OF THIS
COMMON NOODLE DISH. TYPICAL RAMEN NOODLES ARE LONG AND ELASTIC, BUT COUNTLESS
VARIETIES EXIST THAT VARY FROM THIN AND STRAIGHT TO THICK AND WAVY. SOME RAMEN-YA
ALLOW YOU TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR NOODLE ORDER.</p></div></div>

  DEFINING CHARACTERSITIC. TOPPINGS CAN VARY FROM SIMPLE VEGETABLES AND SEASONINGS
  TO FAR MORE COMPLEX MEATS AND SAUCES THAT MUST BE PREPARED SEPARATELY AND IN ADVANCE.
  HERE ARE SOME COMMON ONES YOU MIGHT FIND.</p>
